# this is a readme file

I will be updating information on my python code here

#DICTIONARIES
 eg. dict = {'name': 'beau', 'color': 'blue'}

 there is a key value pair, 
 name = beau and 
 color = blue


LIBRARIES:

import random = import random library
practice F string

#COMMANDS
isinstance
type  

#DATA TYPES
complex for complex numbers
int for integers
float for floating numbers
str for strings
bool for booleans
list for lists
tuple for tuples
range for ranges
dict for dictionaries
set for sets
frozenset for frozensets


Arithmetic Operators:
Used for performing mathematical calculations.
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus - remainder of division)
// (Floor division - quotient without remainder)
** (Exponentiation)
Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.
= (Assign)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
//= (Floor divide and assign)
**= (Exponentiate and assign)
:= (Walrus operator - assign and return in an expression)
Comparison Operators:
Used to compare values.
== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)
Logical Operators:
Used to combine or modify boolean expressions.
and (Returns True if both operands are true)
or (Returns True if at least one operand is true)
not (Returns the opposite of the operand's boolean value)
Identity Operators:
Used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.
is (Returns True if both operands are the same object)
is not (Returns True if both operands are not the same object)
Membership Operators:
Used to check if a value is present in a sequence (e.g., string, list, tuple).
in (Returns True if the value is found in the sequence)
not in (Returns True if the value is not found in the sequence)
Bitwise Operators:
Used to perform operations on individual bits of integers.
& (AND)
| (OR)
^ (XOR)
~ (NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
